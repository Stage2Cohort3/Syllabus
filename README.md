## Assignments and Projects

All assignments will be done through GitHub. 

### GitHub Flow for Single Assignments

1. Instructor makes GitHub Repo for assignment
    - Skip this step when using previously created assignments
1. Students fork the repo into their personal GitHub
1. Students clone their repo locally and work on the assignment
    - Questions about their own code or solutions should be made as issues on their personal fork of the repo
    - Questions about the assignment or for clarification of details should be made as issues on the original repo
1. When a student is finished with their assignment, they will Pull Request it back to the original repo
    - Students should work and commit in master
1. Teachers give feedback on the Pull Request
    - Leave comments, code review in the code itself
1. As Students receive feedback, they can continue to make changes they commit to their master branch. This will update the Pull Request
1. Once the teacher thinks the assignment is complete to their liking, they can close the Pull Request

### GitHub Flow for Longer Projects

Longer group projects will be hosted in an organization GitHub repo. The teacher will create the empty repo and ensure all group members have approprate access to it.

Students will use branching to add features. Teachers and Students will add Issues that need to be addressed, and referenced by number in commit messages.
