# `C# Character Generator`

- Type: Code Along
- Associated Repo: <https://github.com/Stage2Cohort3/csharp_character_generator>

## Instructions

1. Direct students to the main repo, fork it, clone it locally, and read the `README.md` file

## Code Along

1. Create a new solution (.NET Core Console App)
1. Review the instructions for the character generator
    - Students that took the Gateway One exam will find it familiar
1. Ask students to discuss how they accomplished the Character Generator in their exam.
    - Have them say how they would do it in C, then show how that translates into C#
    - Also try backing up into Psuedocode, then how they would do that in C, then how that is done in C#
    - Avoid OO solutions (students with experience in OO will try to use objects(because it's a perfect match for what we're doing!))
    - Show `class`es, but use them like a struct (properties only, no methods)
