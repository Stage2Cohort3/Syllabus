### Account Scores Service idea

Service that generates an account score for an account. Score is based on some factors on the account (+100 for being active this month, +2 for every $100 in CREDIT transactions, -1 for ever $100 in DEBIT transactions, etc) plus some details given to this service (-1 every time a score is retrieved, -5 for every $100 of reported fines, +6 for Galactic Influence?)
